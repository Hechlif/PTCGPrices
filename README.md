# PTCGPrices
A python 3.12 web-scrapping program that scrapes the Price Charting website for information on promo p√≥kemon TCG card prices and organizes them by name on a dataframe in Treeview on tkinter.
It uses bs4, pandas, requests, tkinter and lxml. It is not totally functioning as it can only read the cards and card prices of the inicial loaded part of the page.
If you come across this and want to give me some pointers on it feel free to do so.
Here is the website I scrapped, https://www.pricecharting.com/console/pokemon-promo.
